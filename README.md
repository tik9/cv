I work as a ~~web developer~~ front and back-end developer and as a system administrator. I´m based in Bavaria, Germany.

Since 2018 I've been living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've had the chance to immerse myself in different projects, helping to make this world better through code. ✨
